### Project Title
Movie Rental Data Exploration

### Description
I was provided a workspace within the Udacity classroom portal to access the Sakila DVD Rental Database.

Based on the data, I developed four questions of interest, wrote supporting SQL queries to answer those questions, and finally, designed data visualizations using the final data of my SQL queries.

### Files Used
The database can be found on https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-sample-database/. The database file is dvdrental.tar within dvdrental.zip which is available for free download.
